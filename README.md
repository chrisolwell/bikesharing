### Overview
We set out out to determine if a bike sharing business in Des Moines similar to one we saw in New York would be a good business idea. These specific visualizations concern bike trips in August 2019 and were created in response to interest from a key potential investor. 

### Results

### Summary
Honestly, I'm not much closer to knowing whether or not to start a business in Des Moines. I know a little more about the bike sharing operation in New York City, but does NYC have anything in common with Des Moines? It seems like a prudent investor would need much more data: demographics of both cities, elevation fluctuations ("How would you like to pay me $15 to push this bike up a hill?") of both cities, incomes, etc. Maybe I missed something in the set up, but why would we use this dataset to make this decison?

At the risk of oversimplifying our analysis, all we learned is that more men than women use bike sharing in New York, and that the peak use hours coincide with the traditional peak commuting hours; Do we really need data science to reach this conclusion, or do you think we could've guessed that? There are many opportunities for further analysis, and if I were an investor and you came to me with this analysis I would decline, and I'd probably feel like you'd wasted my time. A wise man once said: follow the money. For pete's sake we don't even know if the NYC operation is profitable. 

Having said all that, which did provide the writer some catharsis, the graphs are visually striking.
