### Summary
Maybe I missed something in the set up, but why would use this dataset to make this decison? Honestly, I'm not much closer to knowing whether or not to start a business in Des Moines. I know a little more about the bike sharing operation in New York City, but does NYC have anything in common with Des Moines? It seems like a prudent investor would need much more data: demographics of both cities, elevation fluctuations ("would like to pay me $15 to push this bike up a hill?") of both cities, incomes, etc. 

At the risk of oversimplifying our analysis, all we learned is that more men than women use bike sharing in New York, and that the peak use hours coincide with the traditional peak commuting hours; Do we really need data science to reach this conclusion, or do you think we could've guessed that? There are many opportunities for further analysis, and if I were an investor and you came to me with this analysis I would decline, and I'd probably feel like you'd wasted my time. For pete's sake we don't even know if the NYC operation is profitable. 

Having said all that, which did provide the writer some catharsis, the graphs are visually striking.
